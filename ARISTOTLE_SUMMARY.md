# Summary of changes for run c1251b50-91ce-4dab-808a-51a0f85be02d
Continued the SAW.tex formalization, working exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz and leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (`lake build`, 8118 jobs, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`).

Status of the Umlaufsatz: its remaining content was already factored, in prior rounds, into a single honest `sorry` — the two-ears / ear-existence core `exists_ear_clip` in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` (a simple, non-degenerate polygon with ≥4 vertices has a clippable convex ear preserving planar simplicity, non-degeneracy, total turning and orientation). This is genuinely Jordan-curve-theorem-level and absent from Mathlib. A direct attempt to discharge it confirmed it is not closable in one pass, so this round builds the proved, reusable geometric foundation that the eventual proof (via Meisters' ear-existence argument) will consume, and preserves the clean single-core state.

New file `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufEar.lean`, imported by `SAWUmlaufPolygon` (hence transitively from `SAWFinal`, so it is part of the build chain), all proved sorry-free (verified to depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):
- `HexArea.cross_smul_left/right`, `cross_sub_left/right` — the ℝ-bilinearity/scalar laws of the 2-D cross product underlying every orientation computation;
- `cross_edges_eq_shoelace2_triple` — the corner orientation `cross (b-a) (c-b)` equals the signed area `shoelace2 [a,b,c]` of the triangle it cuts off (the bridge between corner convexity and the sign of its area, used in Steps 1 and 3 of the ear argument);
- `cross_eq_zero_of_mem_segment`, `collinear_of_mem_segment` — a point on `segment ℝ a b` is collinear with `a,b` (degenerate-diagonal test);
- `exists_lex_min_mem` — every nonempty vertex list has a lexicographically minimal (leftmost-lowest) vertex, the convex extreme vertex the ear search starts from (Step 1);
- the strict-interior predicate `inTriangleStrict` with `inTriangleStrict_ne_a/b/c` and `inTriangleStrict_nondeg` — the empty-triangle / farthest-vertex machinery for Step 2.

These are explicitly documented as preparation for `exists_ear_clip`: they are imported into the chain but not yet referenced by another declaration only because the core they feed is still open, so they are recorded partial progress, not a dead branch. The only other change is the one-line `import` added to `SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` and the status notes in `PROOF_STATUS.md` / `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md`. No axioms or `@[implemented_by]` were introduced. The single remaining Umlaufsatz gap is `exists_ear_clip`, preserved as an honest, well-documented Lean `sorry`.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz ear-existence geometry-toolkit round (NEWEST)

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, 8118 jobs, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`).

The single remaining Umlaufsatz `sorry` is still the two-ears /
ear-existence core `exists_ear_clip` (`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`),
which is genuinely Jordan-curve-theorem-level and absent from Mathlib. This
round builds the **proved, reusable plane-geometry toolkit** that the eventual
proof of `exists_ear_clip` (via Meisters' ear-existence argument) will consume,
in a new file `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufEar.lean`, imported by
`SAWUmlaufPolygon` (hence transitively from `SAWFinal`), so it is part of the
build chain. It is explicitly **preparation**: its lemmas are not yet referenced
by another declaration because the core they feed is still open, but they are
recorded partial progress toward it, not a dead branch.

New, fully proved (only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):
* `HexArea.cross_smul_left/right`, `HexArea.cross_sub_left/right` — the `ℝ`-
  bilinearity / scalar laws of the 2-D cross product used for every orientation
  computation;
* `HexArea.cross_edges_eq_shoelace2_triple` — the orientation of a corner
  `a,b,c` equals the signed area `HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c]` it cuts off (the
  Step-1/Step-3 bridge between convexity of a corner and the sign of its area);
* `HexArea.cross_eq_zero_of_mem_segment`, `HexArea.collinear_of_mem_segment` —
  a point on `segment ℝ a b` is collinear with `a,b` (degenerate-diagonal test);
* `HexArea.exists_lex_min_mem` — every nonempty vertex list has a
  lexicographically minimal (leftmost-lowest) vertex, the convex extreme vertex
  Meisters' ear search starts from (Step 1);
* `HexArea.inTriangleStrict` predicate (strict interior of an oriented triangle
  via the three edge cross products) with `inTriangleStrict_ne_a/b/c` (an
  interior point differs from each vertex) and `inTriangleStrict_nondeg` (a
  triangle with a strict interior point is non-degenerate) — the Step-2
  machinery for the empty-triangle test and the farthest-vertex diagonal.

No other files were changed except the one-line `import` added to
`SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` and the documentation. The clean single-core state of
the Umlaufsatz reduction is preserved; `exists_ear_clip` remains the lone gap.

# Summary of changes for run b4ccddb9-59cb-4c03-9ed4-0ca751d1a911
Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`); all new work is in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`, which is imported transitively from `SAWFinal`.

What changed: the previous lone Umlaufsatz `sorry`, the bundled ear-clipping reduction `polygon_ear_reduction`, is now **proved sorry-free** from a single sharper two-ears core plus a newly built, fully proved rotation-invariance toolkit.

New, fully proved lemmas (each verified to use only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):
- `polyCycWind` — cyclic total turning of a vertex cycle — with `polyCycWind_rotate1` / `polyCycWind_rotate` (cyclic turning is invariant under rotation of the vertex list);
- `shoelace2_rotate1` / `shoelace2_rotate` — signed area is rotation invariant;
- `mem_closedEdges_rotate` and `PolygonSimple_rotate` — planar simplicity is rotation invariant;
- `polyCycNondeg` with `polyCycNondeg_rotate1` / `polyCycNondeg_rotate` — cyclic non-degeneracy is rotation invariant;
- `shoelace2_clip_second` — clipping the second vertex changes the signed area by exactly the cut-off ear-triangle's area.

Using these, `polygon_ear_reduction` is derived by rotating the abstract ear into the second position and transporting the four cyclic invariants (simplicity, non-degeneracy, turning, orientation) back to the polygon's own closing form. This concentrates all the remaining content of the planar Umlaufsatz into one honest, sharply stated `sorry`: `exists_ear_clip`, the genuine Jordan-curve-theorem-level two-ears statement (a simple non-degenerate polygon with ≥4 vertices has a clippable convex ear preserving planar simplicity), which is absent from Mathlib.

Partial progress is preserved as honest, well-documented Lean sorries; the rotation toolkit is explicitly documented as preparation that a future proof of the core will consume, and it is part of the build chain. `PROOF_STATUS.md` and `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md` were updated to record this round. The single remaining Umlaufsatz gap is now `exists_ear_clip`; the honeycomb-planarity core remains closed.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz ear-clipping rotation-toolkit round (NEWEST)

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`); every new declaration
lives in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`, which is imported transitively
from `SAWFinal`.

**Reduced the last Umlaufsatz core to a sharper, concrete two-ears statement and
proved all the ear-clipping glue around it.** Previously the lone remaining
Umlaufsatz `sorry` was the bundled `polygon_ear_reduction`. It is now **proved
sorry-free** from a single new, sharper core `exists_ear_clip` plus a fully
proved rotation-invariance toolkit.

New, fully proved (only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):
* `polyCycWind` — cyclic total turning of a vertex cycle (`= polyWind (V ++ V.take 2)`);
* `polyCycWind_rotate1`, `polyCycWind_rotate` — cyclic turning is invariant under
  cyclic rotation of the vertex list (via `polyWind_append_singleton`);
* `shoelace2_rotate1`, `shoelace2_rotate` — the signed area is rotation invariant;
* `mem_closedEdges_rotate`, `PolygonSimple_rotate` — planar simplicity is
  rotation invariant (the closed-edge set and `Nodup` are preserved);
* `polyCycNondeg`, `polyCycNondeg_rotate1`, `polyCycNondeg_rotate` — cyclic
  non-degeneracy is rotation invariant;
* `shoelace2_clip_second` — clipping the second vertex changes the signed area by
  exactly the cut-off ear-triangle’s area.

With these, `polygon_ear_reduction` is derived by rotating the abstract ear into
the second position and transporting the four cyclic invariants back to `V`’s own
closing form. The single remaining Umlaufsatz `sorry` is now `exists_ear_clip`
(`SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`): the genuine Jordan-curve-theorem-level two-ears
content (existence of a clippable convex ear preserving planar simplicity).
Partial progress is preserved as honest, well-documented Lean sorries; the
rotation toolkit is preparation that the eventual core proof will consume.

# Summary of changes for run ade3861d-c030-4361-93b1-fb879ffe6bb0
Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (`lake build`, 8117 jobs, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`).

**Result: the honeycomb-planarity core of the Umlaufsatz is now completely eliminated.** Previously the Umlaufsatz had two remaining `sorry` cores; one of them — `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` (and hence the planarity lemma `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polygonSimple`) — is now **fully proved, sorry-free**, depending only on the standard axioms `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`.

What was added / proved:
- New self-contained geometry file `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufHexEdge.lean`, imported by `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` (hence transitively from `SAWFinal`), so it is part of the proof chain. It develops, all sorry-free:
  - `hexEdge_dir` — an oriented honeycomb edge embeds to one of three explicit unit directions (`1`, `-1/2 ± (√3/2)·I`);
  - `hexEdge_false_or` — the false/true sublattice parity of an edge's two endpoints;
  - the nine direction-pair leaf lemmas `hexEdge_disjoint_leaf_ij` (two unit honeycomb segments sharing no vertex are disjoint), with the three off-diagonal cases derived from the others by `Disjoint.symm`;
  - the dispatchers `hexEdge_disjoint_d1/d2/d3`, the oriented core `hexEdge_segments_disjoint_oriented`, and the general `hexEdge_segments_disjoint`.
- In `SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`, the combinatorial wiring of `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` is now proved: each polygon edge is a `hexGraph` adjacency between consecutive trail vertices, and the endpoint inequalities transfer to vertex inequalities via `correctHexEmbed_injective`, closing the goal with the general geometric lemma.

Remaining Umlaufsatz gap (now a single one): `polygon_ear_reduction` in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean` — the ear-clipping / two-ears topological core (Jordan-curve-theorem level, absent from Mathlib). Everything around it (the strong-induction `polygon_umlaufsatz_take`, the triangle base case, the closing rewrites, the bridge to the hex core, and now the entire honeycomb planarity side) is proved. Partial progress is preserved as honest, well-documented Lean sorries, and `PROOF_STATUS.md` / `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md` were updated to record that the honeycomb-planarity core is closed and `polygon_ear_reduction` is the single remaining core.

No axioms or `@[implemented_by]` were introduced; all new lemmas were verified to use only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`, and new-file linter warnings were fixed at the source.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz honeycomb-planarity round (newest)

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`).

**Closed the honeycomb-planarity core of the Umlaufsatz entirely.** The lemma
`hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` (`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) —
previously one of the two remaining Umlaufsatz `sorry`s — is now **proved
sorry-free** (only `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`), so
`hexEmbeddedPolygon_polygonSimple` is sorry-free too.

New file `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufHexEdge.lean` (imported by
`SAWUmlaufPolygon`, hence transitively from `SAWFinal`) isolates and proves the
geometric content, all sorry-free:
* `hexEdge_dir` — an oriented honeycomb edge embeds to one of three explicit unit
  directions `1, -1/2 ± (√3/2)·I`;
* `hexEdge_false_or` — false/true parity of an edge's two endpoints;
* the nine direction-pair leaf cases `hexEdge_disjoint_leaf_ij` (two unit
  honeycomb segments sharing no vertex are disjoint; the three off-diagonal
  `i>j` are obtained from `i<j` by `Disjoint.symm`);
* the dispatchers `hexEdge_disjoint_d1/d2/d3`, the oriented core
  `hexEdge_segments_disjoint_oriented`, and the general
  `hexEdge_segments_disjoint`.
The combinatorial wiring in `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` (each polygon
edge is a `hexGraph` adjacency between consecutive trail vertices, with endpoint
inequalities transferred to vertex inequalities via `correctHexEmbed_injective`)
is also proved.

**Remaining Umlaufsatz gap (now a single one):** `polygon_ear_reduction`
(`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) — the ear-clipping / two-ears
topological core. The honeycomb-planarity gap is closed.

# Summary of changes for run e1ca65fb-ca29-43d8-8322-d4d6d86119d6
Continued the SAW.tex formalization, working exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz and leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (`lake build`, 8116 jobs, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`); all new declarations live in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`, which is imported transitively from `SAWFinal` (`SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

What changed (all in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`):

- The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz` previously had a single monolithic `sorry`. It is now **proved**, factored into a clean ear-clipping induction:
  - `closeList_eq` (new, sorry-free): the public closing form `V ++ [V[0], V[1]]` equals the index-free `V ++ V.take 2` used by the induction.
  - `polygon_umlaufsatz_take` (new, **proved** modulo the single bundled core below): the Umlaufsatz in `take 2` closing form, by strong induction on `V.length` — base case `V.length = 3` is the already-proved `polyWind_triangle`, and the inductive step clips an ear via `polygon_ear_reduction`, which keeps total turning and orientation fixed while shortening the polygon.
  - `polygon_umlaufsatz` itself is now derived (sorry-free body) from `polygon_umlaufsatz_take` via `closeList_eq`.
  - `arg_ear_local_mod` (new, **proved sorry-free**): a reusable algebraic lemma — removing one vertex between its neighbours changes the local turning by a multiple of 2π (the turn ratios telescope so `exp(I·Δ)=1`). This is the "easy half" of the turning equality and is preparation for the exact ear step.

- All remaining topological content is now concentrated into a single, honestly-stated `sorry` lemma `polygon_ear_reduction` (a simple non-degenerate polygon with ≥4 vertices has an ear whose removal preserves planar simplicity, non-degeneracy, total turning and orientation — the two-ears / Jordan-curve-theorem-level core, absent from Mathlib). The second remaining Umlaufsatz gap, `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` (honeycomb planarity), is unchanged.

Verification: the new `closeList_eq` and `arg_ear_local_mod` depend only on the standard axioms (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); `polygon_umlaufsatz_take` reduces (via `sorryAx`) exactly to `polygon_ear_reduction` as designed. Partial progress is preserved as Lean files with honest sorries, and the documentation (`PROOF_STATUS.md`, `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md`) was updated to reflect the new factoring and the two remaining cores.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz ear-clipping round (newest)

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, 8116 jobs, including `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`) and every new
declaration lives in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`, imported
transitively from `SAWFinal` (via `SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

**Factored the planar Umlaufsatz into proven induction + one bundled core.**
The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz`
(`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) previously had a single monolithic
`sorry`. It is now **proved sorry-free from** a clean ear-clipping reduction:

* `closeList_eq` (NEW, sorry-free) — the public closing form
  `V ++ [V[0], V[1]]` equals the index-free `V ++ V.take 2` used by the
  induction.
* `polygon_umlaufsatz_take` (NEW, **proved sorry-free** modulo the bundled
  reduction below) — the Umlaufsatz in `take 2` closing form, by strong
  induction on `V.length`: base case `V.length = 3` is the already-proved
  `polyWind_triangle`; the inductive step clips an ear via
  `polygon_ear_reduction`, which keeps both the total turning and the
  orientation (sign of signed area) fixed while strictly shortening the polygon.
* `polygon_umlaufsatz` (now sorry-free) — derived from `polygon_umlaufsatz_take`
  via `closeList_eq`.
* `arg_ear_local_mod` (NEW, **proved sorry-free**) — the reusable algebraic
  "easy half" of the ear-step turning equality: removing one vertex `b` between
  `a` and `c` (preceded by `p`, followed by `q`) changes the local turning by a
  multiple of `2π` (the three turn ratios telescope to the two merged ratios, so
  `exp(I·Δ) = 1`). Isolates the purely-algebraic content; the exact-equality
  (`k = 0`) upgrade is the convexity content inside `polygon_ear_reduction`.

**Remaining Umlaufsatz gaps (two honest, genuinely-true topological cores):**
1. `polygon_ear_reduction` — ear existence + preservation of planar simplicity /
   non-degeneracy / turning / orientation under ear removal
   (two-ears / Jordan-curve-theorem-level; absent from Mathlib). This now
   concentrates *all* of the remaining topological content of the planar
   Umlaufsatz into a single statement; the base case and the entire inductive
   glue around it are proved sorry-free.
2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` — honeycomb planarity (non-adjacent
   embedded edges are disjoint segments), a lattice-geometry fact absent from
   Mathlib.

All new lemmas depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound` (plus, for
the ones built on top of `polygon_ear_reduction`, the recorded `sorry`).

# Summary of changes for run dbbabf08-1f66-48fc-be7c-f6d5ae403050
Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (`lake build`, 8116 jobs) and every new declaration is imported transitively from `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean` (via `SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

**Correctness fix (most important).** The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz` (in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) was **false as previously stated**. `PolygonSimple` (`Nodup` + disjointness of non-adjacent edges) does not exclude three consecutive collinear vertices: for the collinear "spike" `a=0, b=2, c=1` the disjointness clause is vacuous and `Nodup` holds, yet `polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π` while the signed area `HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c] = 0`, so the claimed RHS `2π·sign(area)` would be `-2π ≠ 2π`. That made the existing `sorry` unfillable. I added a non-degeneracy hypothesis `polyNondeg (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])` (no flat/spike turns; every cyclic turn has nonzero cross product), which restores truth, and threaded it through the honeycomb consumer `hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace`.

**New sorry-free lemmas (all depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):**
- `polyNondeg` predicate + `hexTrailList_map_emb_polyNondeg` (embedding of any hex trail is non-degenerate, via `hex_turn_cross_ne_zero`);
- `hexClosedTrail_dropLast_append_trailList` (the closed vertex cycle `L.dropLast ++ [L[0], L[1]]` is a `HexTrailList`);
- `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polyNondeg` (discharges the new hypothesis for the honeycomb polygon, so the corrected statement is genuinely usable);
- `polyWind_triangle` — the **triangle base case** of the planar Umlaufsatz (`polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π·sign(signed area)` for a non-degenerate triangle), the base case of the ear-clipping induction.

**Remaining gaps (two clean, genuinely-true topological cores, now correctly stated):**
1. `polygon_umlaufsatz` — the turning-tangent theorem for a non-self-intersecting non-degenerate polygon; the triangle base case is now proved, leaving the ear-clipping induction whose irreducible content is the two-ears / Jordan-curve theorem (absent from Mathlib).
2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` — honeycomb planarity (non-adjacent embedded edges are disjoint segments), a lattice-geometry fact absent from Mathlib.

Status notes were updated in `PROOF_STATUS.md` and `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md`. Net effect: an unfillable (false-statement) `sorry` was replaced by a correct statement plus four verified building blocks, reducing the remaining Umlaufsatz content to two honest, well-documented topological cores.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz round

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, 8116 jobs) and every new declaration is imported transitively
from `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean` (via
`SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

## Correctness fix (most important)

The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz`
(`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) was **false as previously stated**.
`PolygonSimple` (`Nodup` + disjointness of *non-adjacent* edges) does not
exclude three consecutive collinear vertices: for the collinear "spike"
`a = 0, b = 2, c = 1` the disjointness clause is vacuous and `Nodup` holds, yet
`polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = arg(-1/2)+arg(1)+arg(-2) = 2π` while
`HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c] = 0`, so the claimed RHS `2π·sign(area)` would be
`-2π ≠ 2π`. The previous proof obligation was therefore unfillable.

**Fix.** Added a non-degeneracy hypothesis `polyNondeg (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])`
(every cyclic turn has nonzero cross product, i.e. no three consecutive
collinear vertices) to `polygon_umlaufsatz`, making the statement true. A new
predicate `polyNondeg` is defined for this. The hypothesis is genuinely
satisfied by the honeycomb embedding, and that fact is now **proved sorry-free**
(see below), so the hex Umlaufsatz core `hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace`
(in `SAWUmlaufSignedArea.lean`) still type-checks and is derived from a *true*
general statement.

## New sorry-free lemmas (all depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

In `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`:

- `hexTrailList_map_emb_polyNondeg` — for any honeycomb trail `M`, the embedded
  chain `M.map correctHexEmbed` is non-degenerate (each consecutive triple is a
  genuine hex turn with cross `±√3/2 ≠ 0`, via `hex_turn_cross_ne_zero`).
- `hexClosedTrail_dropLast_append_trailList` — the closed honeycomb vertex cycle
  `L.dropLast ++ [L[0], L[1]]` is itself a `HexTrailList` (interior structure
  from `HexTrailList L`; the two closing turns from `hex_closure_adj` /
  `hex_closure_nobacktrack`; the junction no-backtrack from
  `hex_closed_trail_start_not_interior`).
- `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polyNondeg` — discharges the new `polyNondeg` hypothesis of
  `polygon_umlaufsatz` for the embedded honeycomb polygon.
- `polyWind_triangle` — the **triangle base case** of the planar Umlaufsatz:
  for a non-degenerate triangle, `polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π·sign(signed area)`.
  Proof: the three turn ratios have product `1` (so the arg sum is a multiple of
  `2π` via `Complex.arg_mul_coe_angle`), and the three triangle cross products
  are equal to the signed area (`shoelace2_triple`, `cross_triangle_eq_cross_edges`),
  so the three exterior angles share the area's sign and lie in `(-π,π)`, forcing
  the sum to be `±2π`. This is the base case of the ear-clipping induction.

## Remaining gaps (two clean, genuinely-true topological cores, now correctly stated)

1. `polygon_umlaufsatz` — the classical turning-tangent theorem for a
   non-self-intersecting *non-degenerate* polygon in `ℂ`. The triangle base case
   is now proved (`polyWind_triangle`); what remains is the ear-clipping
   induction whose irreducible content is the two-ears theorem (a simple polygon
   with `≥ 4` vertices has an ear and ear removal preserves planar simplicity) —
   Jordan-curve-theorem-level, absent from Mathlib.
2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` — honeycomb planarity (non-adjacent edges
   of the embedded polygon are disjoint segments), a finite lattice geometry
   fact absent from Mathlib.

All analytic / combinatorial glue connecting the integer signed-turn count ↔
real turning ↔ signed-area sign remains proved sorry-free.
