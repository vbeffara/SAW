# Summary of changes for run dbbabf08-1f66-48fc-be7c-f6d5ae403050
Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully (`lake build`, 8116 jobs) and every new declaration is imported transitively from `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean` (via `SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

**Correctness fix (most important).** The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz` (in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) was **false as previously stated**. `PolygonSimple` (`Nodup` + disjointness of non-adjacent edges) does not exclude three consecutive collinear vertices: for the collinear "spike" `a=0, b=2, c=1` the disjointness clause is vacuous and `Nodup` holds, yet `polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π` while the signed area `HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c] = 0`, so the claimed RHS `2π·sign(area)` would be `-2π ≠ 2π`. That made the existing `sorry` unfillable. I added a non-degeneracy hypothesis `polyNondeg (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])` (no flat/spike turns; every cyclic turn has nonzero cross product), which restores truth, and threaded it through the honeycomb consumer `hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace`.

**New sorry-free lemmas (all depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`):**
- `polyNondeg` predicate + `hexTrailList_map_emb_polyNondeg` (embedding of any hex trail is non-degenerate, via `hex_turn_cross_ne_zero`);
- `hexClosedTrail_dropLast_append_trailList` (the closed vertex cycle `L.dropLast ++ [L[0], L[1]]` is a `HexTrailList`);
- `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polyNondeg` (discharges the new hypothesis for the honeycomb polygon, so the corrected statement is genuinely usable);
- `polyWind_triangle` — the **triangle base case** of the planar Umlaufsatz (`polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π·sign(signed area)` for a non-degenerate triangle), the base case of the ear-clipping induction.

**Remaining gaps (two clean, genuinely-true topological cores, now correctly stated):**
1. `polygon_umlaufsatz` — the turning-tangent theorem for a non-self-intersecting non-degenerate polygon; the triangle base case is now proved, leaving the ear-clipping induction whose irreducible content is the two-ears / Jordan-curve theorem (absent from Mathlib).
2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` — honeycomb planarity (non-adjacent embedded edges are disjoint segments), a lattice-geometry fact absent from Mathlib.

Status notes were updated in `PROOF_STATUS.md` and `ARISTOTLE_SUMMARY.md`. Net effect: an unfillable (false-statement) `sorry` was replaced by a correct statement plus four verified building blocks, reducing the remaining Umlaufsatz content to two honest, well-documented topological cores.

# Summary of changes — Umlaufsatz round

Worked exclusively on the top-priority discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz, leaving all
other branches untouched. The whole library still builds successfully
(`lake build`, 8116 jobs) and every new declaration is imported transitively
from `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean` (via
`SAWUmlaufSignedArea → SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

## Correctness fix (most important)

The general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz `polygon_umlaufsatz`
(`RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`) was **false as previously stated**.
`PolygonSimple` (`Nodup` + disjointness of *non-adjacent* edges) does not
exclude three consecutive collinear vertices: for the collinear "spike"
`a = 0, b = 2, c = 1` the disjointness clause is vacuous and `Nodup` holds, yet
`polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = arg(-1/2)+arg(1)+arg(-2) = 2π` while
`HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c] = 0`, so the claimed RHS `2π·sign(area)` would be
`-2π ≠ 2π`. The previous proof obligation was therefore unfillable.

**Fix.** Added a non-degeneracy hypothesis `polyNondeg (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])`
(every cyclic turn has nonzero cross product, i.e. no three consecutive
collinear vertices) to `polygon_umlaufsatz`, making the statement true. A new
predicate `polyNondeg` is defined for this. The hypothesis is genuinely
satisfied by the honeycomb embedding, and that fact is now **proved sorry-free**
(see below), so the hex Umlaufsatz core `hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace`
(in `SAWUmlaufSignedArea.lean`) still type-checks and is derived from a *true*
general statement.

## New sorry-free lemmas (all depend only on `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`)

In `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufPolygon.lean`:

- `hexTrailList_map_emb_polyNondeg` — for any honeycomb trail `M`, the embedded
  chain `M.map correctHexEmbed` is non-degenerate (each consecutive triple is a
  genuine hex turn with cross `±√3/2 ≠ 0`, via `hex_turn_cross_ne_zero`).
- `hexClosedTrail_dropLast_append_trailList` — the closed honeycomb vertex cycle
  `L.dropLast ++ [L[0], L[1]]` is itself a `HexTrailList` (interior structure
  from `HexTrailList L`; the two closing turns from `hex_closure_adj` /
  `hex_closure_nobacktrack`; the junction no-backtrack from
  `hex_closed_trail_start_not_interior`).
- `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polyNondeg` — discharges the new `polyNondeg` hypothesis of
  `polygon_umlaufsatz` for the embedded honeycomb polygon.
- `polyWind_triangle` — the **triangle base case** of the planar Umlaufsatz:
  for a non-degenerate triangle, `polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = 2π·sign(signed area)`.
  Proof: the three turn ratios have product `1` (so the arg sum is a multiple of
  `2π` via `Complex.arg_mul_coe_angle`), and the three triangle cross products
  are equal to the signed area (`shoelace2_triple`, `cross_triangle_eq_cross_edges`),
  so the three exterior angles share the area's sign and lie in `(-π,π)`, forcing
  the sum to be `±2π`. This is the base case of the ear-clipping induction.

## Remaining gaps (two clean, genuinely-true topological cores, now correctly stated)

1. `polygon_umlaufsatz` — the classical turning-tangent theorem for a
   non-self-intersecting *non-degenerate* polygon in `ℂ`. The triangle base case
   is now proved (`polyWind_triangle`); what remains is the ear-clipping
   induction whose irreducible content is the two-ears theorem (a simple polygon
   with `≥ 4` vertices has an ear and ear removal preserves planar simplicity) —
   Jordan-curve-theorem-level, absent from Mathlib.
2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_edges_disjoint` — honeycomb planarity (non-adjacent edges
   of the embedded polygon are disjoint segments), a finite lattice geometry
   fact absent from Mathlib.

All analytic / combinatorial glue connecting the integer signed-turn count ↔
real turning ↔ signed-area sign remains proved sorry-free.
