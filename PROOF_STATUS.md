> * New sorry-free lemma `interior_split_nondeg` (verified to use only
>   `propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`): the companion of
>   `interior_split_simple`.  Given the two *genuine* seam clearances at the cut

>   incident to `w`: `hseamL` for the predecessor edge, `hseamR` for the
>   successor edge), BOTH pieces `chordLeft`/`chordRight` of the `b`-rooted
>   cycle `b :: c :: rest ++ [a]` cut along `b–w` are `polyCycNondeg`.  The other
>   two seam corners (at the apex `b`) are discharged automatically from
>   `hwin : inTriangleStrict a b c w` (`w` off lines `b–c` and `a–b`).  Net
>   effect: combined with `interior_split_simple`, both split pieces are now
>   `PolygonSimple` ∧ `polyCycNondeg` ∧ strictly shorter — i.e. FULLY READY for
>   the `IH2` recursion.  The interior branch's only remaining content is now
>   exactly (i) the two genuine seam clearances `hseamL`/`hseamR` — the
>   degenerate-diagonal geometry recorded as the obstruction in earlier rounds —
>   and (ii) the ear lift / assembly.
> * Structural refactor: extracted `meisters_reduction_empty2`'s bad-diagonal
>   subcase into a single targetable declaration `empty_branch_bad_lift`
>   (carrying the `sorry`), mirroring the existing `empty_branch_good_lift` /
>   `empty_branch_boundary_lift` split, and rewired the empty-branch call site to
>   consume it.  No change to the genuine sorry count.

> The genuine remaining `sorry`s of the Umlaufsatz chain are now

> `HexArea.closedEdge_mem_chord_pathEdges` (only `propext`, `Classical.choice`,

>   branch.
> * New sorry-free lemma `interior_split_simple` (only `propext`,
>   `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`): both pieces `chordLeft`/`chordRight` of
>   the `b`-rooted cycle `b :: c :: rest ++ [a]` cut along the diagonal `b–w`
>   are `PolygonSimple`, with cut index `k` satisfying `2 ≤ k` and

>   simplicity half of the interior split, assembled from
>   `interior_chord_is_diagonal` + the banked simplicity bricks + rotation
>   toolkit.
> * Recorded (in `meisters_reduction_interior2`'s docstring) the remaining
>   obstruction: the `polyCycNondeg` half is NOT unconditionally true — the
>   interior diagonal `b–w` can be collinear with the edge `prev–w` at `w`,

**Location:** `RequestProject/SAWFinal.lean`

## Critical Path — Two Independent Sorry Chains

### Chain A: Vertex Relation → Strip Identity → Z(x) < ∞

**Root cause:** `umlaufsatz_pm_one` (in SAWTurningNumber.lean), the
"hard half" of `hex_closed_trail_turning_number`.

The discrete Gauss-Bonnet theorem for simple closed hex trails:
for a simple closed trail L on the hex lattice, hexWalkWinding L + closure = ±2π.

This theorem is now **split into two halves**:

* **Easy half — PROVED:** `hex_closed_winding_int_mul` shows the total turning
  `hexWalkWinding L + closure` is an integer multiple `2π·n`. Proved via a new
  telescoping identity `hexTrailList_winding_telescope` (every hex turn ratio
  has unit modulus, so `exp(i·arg(d₂/d₁)) = d₂/d₁`, and the product telescopes;
  for a closed trail the first and last edge directions coincide, giving
  `exp(i·(W+closure)) = 1`). Supporting lemmas (`hexFirstDir`,
  `hexFirstDir_append`, `hexFirstDir_eq_get`, `hex_edge_norm_one'`,
  `exp_I_arg_of_norm_one`, `hexTrailList_adj_last`,
  `list_get_last_eq_get_zero_of_closed`) are all sorry-free.

* **Hard half — now REDUCED to a clean combinatorial core:** `umlaufsatz_pm_one`
  shows that for a *simple* (non-self-intersecting) closed trail, the multiple
  `n` equals `±1`. This is the genuine content of Hopf's Umlaufsatz / turning
  tangent theorem and is equivalent in difficulty to the Jordan curve theorem
  for polygons.

  `umlaufsatz_pm_one` is **no longer itself a sorry**: it is now *derived*,
  sorry-free, from a single purely-combinatorial (integer) statement
  `hex_total_signed_turn_pm_six` (in SAWTurningNumber.lean). The analytic
  connective tissue is all proved sorry-free:
  - `hexWalkWinding_eq_signedTurnCount`: total interior winding
    `= (π/3)·hexSignedTurnCount L`;
  - `hex_closure_adj`, `hex_closure_nobacktrack`, `hex_closure_arg_eq_sign`
    (NEW): the closing turn `L[m-2]→L[0]→L[1]` is a genuine non-backtracking
    hex turn whose angle is `(π/3)·hexTurnSign …`;
  - `hex_interior_get_ne` (NEW): distinct interior indices give distinct
    vertices.
  Together these give `hexSignedTurnCount L + closingSign = 6·n`, so `n = ±1`
  iff the total signed turn equals `±6`.

  **The ONLY remaining sorry in this chain is now**
  `hex_total_signed_turn_pm_six`: for a simple closed hex trail the sum of the
  `±1` per-vertex turn signs (interior turns `hexSignedTurnCount L` plus the
  closing-turn sign) equals `±6`. Same topological content (Jordan curve
  theorem for polygons) but in its cleanest analysis-free integer form, ready
  for an ear-clipping / discrete Gauss–Bonnet attack. Not currently in Mathlib.

`hex_closed_trail_turning_number` itself is fully proved *from* these two
halves, so the only remaining gap in this chain is `hex_total_signed_turn_pm_six`.

**Signed-area route to `umlaufsatz_pm_one` (algebraic half built, sorry-free).**
The `±1` value is the sign of the polygon's signed area. The algebraic backbone
of this route is now in place:

* `RequestProject/SAWSignedArea.lean` — the shoelace functional
  `HexArea.shoelace2` (twice the signed area) with `cross`/`shoelace2` algebra,
  `shoelace2_reverse` (reversal negates area), `shoelace2_map_add_const`
  (translation invariance) and `shoelace2_ear` (the exact ear-clipping change of
  signed area). All sorry-free.
* `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufBridge.lean` — `hex_turn_cross`: each turn's sign
  equals the sign of the cross product (`±√3/2`) of its two unit edge vectors,
  and `cross_eq_normSq_mul_im_div`. All sorry-free.

Both files are imported from `SAWFinal.lean`. What remains for `umlaufsatz_pm_one`
is the irreducible *topological* half (a simple polygon has nonzero signed area,
and the turning number equals the sign of that area), which is the same content
as the Jordan curve theorem for polygons and is still absent from Mathlib.

**Simplicity transfer (now built sorry-free).** A further prerequisite for the
signed-area route — that the embedded polygon is a *genuine* simple polygon in
`ℂ` — is now established sorry-free in `RequestProject/SAWUmlaufEmbed.lean`:
* `correctHexEmbed_injective` — the hex embedding is injective;
* `hex_four_neighbours_not_nodup` — the lattice's 3-regularity (pigeonhole);
* `hexTrailList_adj_get`, `hexTrailList_nobacktrack_get`,
  `hex_interior_getElem_ne` — index-level trail structure;
* `hex_closed_trail_start_not_interior` — the start vertex of a simple closed
  hex trail never recurs among the interior vertices (degree-3 + no-backtrack);
* `hex_closed_trail_dropLast_nodup` — hence the full vertex cycle is `Nodup`;
* `hex_closed_trail_embed_nodup` — therefore the embedded polygon
  `L.dropLast.map correctHexEmbed` has pairwise distinct points in `ℂ`.
This turns the weak hypothesis `h_simple : L.tail.dropLast.Nodup` into the
"simple polygon in the plane" statement the topological half consumes. The file
is imported from `SAWFinal.lean` and depends only on the standard axioms.

**Full chain:**
```
hex_closed_trail_turning_number (SORRY — root cause, Umlaufsatz)
  → pair_winding_relation (SORRY — needs turning number + orientation)
    → pair_exp_cancellation (PROVED)
      → pair_contrib_cancels (PROVED)
        → freshVertexSum_pair_part_zero_proved (PROVED)
          → fresh_vertex_relation (PROVED) [= Lemma 1]
            → finite_strip_identity_from_vr (SORRY — needs discrete Stokes)
              → B_paper_le_one_from_vr (PROVED)
                → paper_bridge_partial_sum_shifted_le (PROVED, in SAWDiagProof)
                  → paper_bridge_partial_sum_le (PROVED)
                    → bridge_decay → HW bound
                      → hw_summable_corrected [Z(x) < ∞ for x < xc]
```

### Chain B: Infinite Strip Identity → Z(xc) = ∞

**Root cause:** `infinite_strip_identity` (SAWRecurrenceProof.lean:56)

The identity 1 = c_α·A_inf + xc·B for the infinite strip. This is the
L→∞ limit of the finite strip identity (Chain A).

```
infinite_strip_identity (SORRY)
  → bridge_recurrence_proved (PROVED)
    → Z_xc_diverges_corrected [Z(xc) = ∞]
```

## Critical Correctness Issue: IsTrail vs IsPath

### The Problem

`FreshTrail` in `SAWPathVertexRelation.lean` uses `walk.IsTrail` (no repeated
edges) instead of `walk.IsPath` (no repeated vertices / SAW). The paper's
argument requires self-avoiding walks (SAWs), not just trails.

On the hex lattice (degree 3), a trail is a SAW at all interior vertices
(since visiting a vertex twice would use 4 edges but there are only 3).
However, the **starting vertex** (paperStart) can be revisited: the trail
uses 1 edge at the start, and the inner walk can later visit paperStart
using the remaining 2 edges.

### Why It Matters

A trail that revisits paperStart can create a CW loop (clockwise-oriented
simple closed polygon). For CW loops with specific index configurations,
the pair cancellation identity FAILS:

```
j̄ · exp(-iπ/3) + j · exp(iπ/3) = -2 ≠ 0
```

This means `freshVertexSum = 0` (the vertex relation) is FALSE for trails
that revisit paperStart. The vertex relation only holds for SAWs.

A concrete counterexample: in a strip with T=2, L=2, the trail
paperStart → v → nbr₁ → ... → paperStart → ... → nbr₂ creates a CW
loop that contributes -2·d₀·exp(-iσW_prefix) to the vertex sum, which
does not cancel with its pair.

### The Fix

Change `FreshTrail.is_trail : walk.IsTrail` to `FreshTrail.is_path : walk.IsPath`.
This requires:
1. Updating `freshExtend` to prove IsPath for extended walks
2. Updating `pairInvol` to prove IsPath for paired walks
3. Adding a helper lemma: `vEdgeCount v w = 0 ∧ v ≠ start → v ∉ w.support`

Both freshExtend and pairInvol preserve the IsPath property:
- freshExtend adds v to the end; v ∉ support since vEdgeCount = 0
- pairInvol swaps exit/k directions; the paired walk has the same vertex
  set as the original (minus one endpoint, plus another that wasn't visited)

The fix is documented but not yet implemented to avoid breaking the
existing compilation. The fix is REQUIRED for pair_winding_relation
(and hence the main theorem) to be provable.

## All Sorry Locations (11 total)

### Critical path (4 sorry's):
1. `hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace` (SAWUmlaufSignedArea.lean) —
   **ROOT CAUSE A**.  The discrete Umlaufsatz for hex lattice polygons, now in
   its cleanest *inductive* signed-area form: total signed turn
   `= 6 · sign (HexArea.shoelace2 (hexEmbeddedPolygon L))`.  This equality is
   strictly stronger than the bare `±6` disjunction (it pins the orientation)
   and is the invariant maintained by an ear-clipping / discrete Gauss–Bonnet
   induction.

   **Now derived sorry-free from this single core:**
   * `hex_total_signed_turn_pm_six` (SAWUmlaufGaussBonnet.lean) — the bare `±6`
     disjunction, an immediate consequence (`6 · (if 0<area then 1 else -1)` is
     always `±6`).
   * `umlaufsatz_pm_one`, `hex_closed_trail_turning_number` — as before.

   **Supporting sorry-free infrastructure added for the inductive proof:**
   * base case (SAWUmlaufHexagon.lean): `hexHexagon_signed_turn` (one face has
     total signed turn +6), `hexHexagon_shoelace2_eq` (its embedded area is
     `3√3`), `hexHexagon_shoelace2_pos` (area > 0) — fixing the sign convention;
   * ear step (SAWUmlaufBridge.lean): `cross_triangle_eq_cross_edges` and
     `hexTurnSign_eq_ear_area_sign` (the ear-step signed-area change has the
     same sign as the turn sign at the cut vertex), the exact compatibility the
     induction's invariant needs;
   * `HexArea.shoelace2_ear` (area change on cutting a vertex) and
     `hex_closed_trail_embed_nodup` (the embedded polygon is genuinely simple).

   What remains is the irreducible topological content: a simple polygon has an
   ear (two-ears theorem / Jordan curve theorem for polygons), absent from
   Mathlib.
2. `pair_winding_relation` (SAWPairCancellation.lean:173) — needs #1 + orientation
3. `finite_strip_identity_from_vr` (SAWStripIdentityFromVR.lean:84) — discrete Stokes
4. `infinite_strip_identity` (SAWRecurrenceProof.lean:56) — **ROOT CAUSE B**
   L→∞ limit of #3.

### Dead branches (7 sorry's, NOT on critical path):
5. `trail_vertex_relation` (SAWCancellationIdentity.lean:305) — superseded by fresh version
6. `B_paper_le_one_strip` (SAWStripIdentityCorrect.lean:385) — SUPERSEDED by
   B_paper_le_one_from_vr
7. `strip_observable_summable` (SAWStripObservable.lean:173) — not needed
8. `triplet_part_zero` (SAWTrailVertexRelation.lean:274) — superseded
9. `pair_part_zero` (SAWTrailVertexRelation.lean:282) — superseded
10. `hex_simple_closed_trail_winding` (SAWWindingDiff.lean:72) — alternative formulation
11. `pair_winding_diff` depends on #2 (circular, not independently needed)

Note: `pair_winding_diff` (SAWWindingDiff.lean:91) is derived from pair_winding_relation
and is not a separate sorry — it's proved from the sorry'd lemma.

## Why the Remaining Sorry's Are Hard

### hex_closed_trail_turning_number (Umlaufsatz)
This is equivalent to proving that a simple closed polygon in the plane
has total exterior angle ±2π. On the hex lattice:
- Each turn is ±π/3 (proved: `hex_turn_value`)
- For a closed polygon, the sum is 6k·(π/3) = 2kπ
- The claim is |k| = 1 for SIMPLE (non-self-intersecting) polygons

Proving |k| = 1 requires one of:
- The Jordan curve theorem (not in Mathlib)
- A constructive ear-clipping argument
- A signed area / Pick's theorem argument
- A crossing number argument

None of these foundations are currently in Mathlib.

### pair_winding_relation (Turning Number + Orientation)
Beyond the turning number theorem, this requires determining the SIGN
of the turning (CW vs CCW). The sign is determined by:
1. The planarity of the hex lattice embedding
2. The CCW ordering of neighbors (d₁ = j·d₀ with j = exp(2πi/3))
3. The blocking effect of the prefix path on loop orientation

For SAW-based pair walks (with the IsPath fix), the prefix path from
paperStart to v prevents the inner walk from going "the wrong way"
around v. This constrains the loop to have the correct orientation
for pair cancellation. Formalizing this requires the IsPath fix.

### finite_strip_identity_from_vr (Discrete Stokes)
The argument sums freshVertexSum over all interior vertices:
1. Interior mid-edges cancel: z is the midpoint of its edge, so
   (z-u) + (z-w) = 0 for the two endpoints u, w
2. Boundary mid-edges survive
3. Boundary evaluation gives the partition functions A, B, E

Each step is conceptually simple but requires substantial bookkeeping:
- Define interior vs boundary vertices of the strip
- Define interior vs boundary mid-edges
- Show the cancellation for interior mid-edges
- Evaluate boundary contributions (winding at each boundary type)

### infinite_strip_identity (Limit)
Derived from finite_strip_identity_from_vr by taking L→∞:
- A_paper(T,L) → A_inf(T) as L→∞ (monotone convergence)
- B_paper(T,L) → B_inf(T) as L→∞ (monotone convergence)
- E_paper(T,L) → E_inf(T) as L→∞

The identity 1 = c_α·A_inf + B_inf + c_ε·E_inf follows. If E_inf = 0,
this gives 1 = c_α·A_inf + xc·B.
