## Content

This file formalizes:
1. The cutting argument: walks in A_{T+1} \ A_T decompose into bridge pairs
2. Equation (7): A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · (B_{T+1})²
3. The inductive step for the half-plane walk decomposition
4. Properties of the reverse procedure

## Mathematical context

From the paper (Section 3):
"A walk γ entering into the count of A_{T+1} and not into A_T has to
visit some vertex adjacent to the right edge of S_{T+1}. Cutting γ at
the first such point (and adding half-edges to the two halves), we
uniquely decompose it into two walks crossing S_{T+1} (these walks are
usually called bridges), which together are one step longer than γ."

The factor x_c in the inequality A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}²
comes from this extra step: the two bridges together account for
ℓ(γ) + 1 steps (the connecting vertex is counted in both), and
x_c^{ℓ(γ)+1} = x_c · x_c^{ℓ(γ)} gives the extra factor of x_c.

/-! ## The cutting argument

A self-avoiding walk γ starting at the left boundary of S_{T+1} and
ending at the left boundary, that is NOT contained in S_T, must cross
through the strip boundary at Re = (3(T+1)+1)/2.

The cutting procedure:
1. Find the first vertex v_k of γ with Re value equal to the right boundary
2. The portion γ[0..k] forms a bridge from left to right
3. The portion γ[k..end] (reversed) forms another bridge from right to left
4. Together, these two bridges account for all of γ's vertices plus the
   connecting vertex v_k (counted in both bridges)

This gives: ℓ(bridge₁) + ℓ(bridge₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1
And hence: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) - 1} = x_c⁻¹ · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}

Since x_c < 1, this gives: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} ≤ x_c · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}
Wait, x_c < 1 and we want ≤, so: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)-1}
Since ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1, x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{-1} · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)}
This is WRONG: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} is larger (since x_c < 1 and ℓ(γ) < ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)).

The correct reasoning:
  x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) - 1}
              = x_c^{-1} · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}

Summing over all γ in A_{T+1} \ A_T:
  Σ x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{-1} · Σ x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}

The RHS is bounded by x_c^{-1} · (Σ x_c^{ℓ(b)})² = x_c^{-1} · B_{T+1}²
Wait, that would give A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c^{-1} · B_{T+1}²

But the paper says A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}². Let me re-read.

Actually, the paper says "which together are one step LONGER than γ".
So ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1, hence
  x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) - 1}

But wait, the sum is x_c^{ℓ(γ)}, and the product of bridge weights
is x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)} = x_c^{ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂)} = x_c^{ℓ(γ)+1}
= x_c · x_c^{ℓ(γ)}

So: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = x_c^{-1} · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}

Hmm, but that gives A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ (1/x_c) · B_{T+1}², not x_c · B_{T+1}².

Actually, rethinking: the inequality direction matters. Since the map
γ ↦ (b₁, b₂) is an injection (not a surjection), we have:

  A_{T+1} - A_T = Σ_{γ ∈ A_{T+1}\A_T} x_c^{ℓ(γ)}
                 = Σ_{γ} x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)-1}
                 ≤ (1/x_c) · Σ_{(b₁,b₂)} x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)}
                 ≤ (1/x_c) · (Σ_b x_c^{ℓ(b)})²
                 = (1/x_c) · B_{T+1}²

Wait, but the paper states A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}². Let me re-read the paper more carefully.

From the paper: "we uniquely decompose it into two walks crossing S_{T+1}
(these walks are usually called bridges), which together are one step longer
than γ"

So indeed ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1.

Then A_{T+1} - A_T = Σ x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = Σ x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)-1}

Now, this sum is over specific pairs (b₁, b₂), not all pairs. So:
  Σ x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)-1} ≤ x_c^{-1} · Σ x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}
                           ≤ x_c^{-1} · (Σ_b x_c^{ℓ(b)})²

Wait, but this gives A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c^{-1} · B_{T+1}².

Let me look at equation (7) in the paper again... "A_{T+1}^{x_c} - A_T^{x_c} ≤ x_c (B_{T+1}^{x_c})²"

Hmm, maybe the extra step counting works differently. Maybe the bridges
don't overlap at the connecting vertex but instead share half-edges.
The paper works with mid-edges, and the cutting adds half-edges to both
parts, which adds ONE extra step total (not one per bridge).

Actually I think the key is: cutting at the vertex and adding half-edges.
The walk γ has ℓ(γ) vertices. When cut at vertex v_k, we get:
- Walk from left mid-edge a to v_k (plus a half-edge to the right of v_k)
- Walk from v_k to the left boundary mid-edge (plus a half-edge from the right of v_k)

The total vertex count is ℓ(γ) for γ, and the two bridges together have
ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) vertices. Since v_k is counted in both bridges:
  ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1

So x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)} = x_c^{ℓ(γ)+1} = x_c · x_c^{ℓ(γ)}

Therefore: x_c^{ℓ(γ)} = (1/x_c) · x_c^{ℓ(b₁)} · x_c^{ℓ(b₂)}

Summing: A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ (1/x_c) · Σ_{pairs} x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)}

But the injection maps distinct γ to distinct (b₁, b₂) pairs, and these
pairs are a subset of all bridge pairs. So:
  Σ_{pairs from cutting} x_c^{ℓ(b₁)+ℓ(b₂)} ≤ (Σ_b x_c^{ℓ(b)})² = B_{T+1}²

Hence: A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ (1/x_c) · B_{T+1}²

Hmm, but the paper says x_c, not 1/x_c. Let me reconsider.

Maybe the "one step longer" means the total is one STEP longer, where
each step in the walk connects two vertices. The walk has ℓ(γ) vertices
(the length), which means ℓ(γ) - 1 edges (hmm, actually the paper says
"the length ℓ(γ) of the walk is the number of vertices visited by γ").

Wait, no. "The length ℓ(γ) of the walk is the number of vertices visited
by γ." So length = number of vertices.

For a bridge, the length is also the number of vertices. When we cut
γ at vertex v_k, the bridge b₁ from left to v_k has some number of
vertices, and the bridge b₂ from v_k back to the left has some other
number of vertices. The vertex v_k is in both, so:
  ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1

OK so my calculation is correct and A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ (1/x_c) · B_{T+1}².

But the paper says "A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}²". Let me look again...

Hmm, maybe the paper counts edges not vertices? Or maybe the bridge sum
uses a different convention? Or perhaps the "one step longer" means
something else?

Actually, I think I may be confused about the weight. The partition
function for bridges counts weight x^{ℓ(γ)} where ℓ is the number of
VERTICES. But the paper's walk length might be the number of edges instead.

Actually re-reading the paper: "The length ℓ(γ) of the walk is the
number of vertices visited by γ." So yes, it's vertices.

But then the inequality A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}² seems off.
Let me re-examine.

Hmm, maybe the issue is the direction of the inequality. Let me look at
how the recurrence is used in the paper. The recurrence is combined with
the strip identity to get:
  B_T ≤ c_α · x_c · B_{T+1}² + B_{T+1}

From the strip identity: 0 = c_α(A_{T+1} - A_T) + (B_{T+1} - B_T) + c_ε(E_{T+1} - E_T)
So: B_T - B_{T+1} = c_α(A_{T+1} - A_T) + c_ε(E_{T+1} - E_T)
    ≤ c_α(A_{T+1} - A_T)  (since E decreases)
    ≤ c_α · x_c · B_{T+1}²

This gives B_T ≤ c_α · x_c · B_{T+1}² + B_{T+1}, which matches the paper.

So indeed the paper states A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}².
That means the multiplicative factor should be x_c, not 1/x_c.

Let me re-examine. Perhaps the definition of "bridge length" in the paper
uses edges, not vertices, for the x^{ℓ} weight? Or perhaps it's
B_{T+1}^{x_c} that is defined differently.

Actually, let me re-examine. The partition function:
  A_T^x = Σ_{γ ⊂ S_T : a → α\{a}} x^{ℓ(γ)}

where ℓ(γ) = number of vertices.

The bridge partition function:
  B_T^x = Σ_{γ ⊂ S_T : a → β} x^{ℓ(γ)}

Now, the cutting of γ ∈ A_{T+1} \ A_T gives two "bridges" (walks
crossing S_{T+1}). But these are not exactly bridges in B_{T+1}
because their orientations are different:
- b₁ goes from left to right (contributes to B_{T+1})
- b₂ goes from a point on the right to the left (reverse bridge)

By symmetry (the walk can be reversed), the reverse bridge has the
same partition function as a forward bridge. But the vertex count:

If γ visits vertices v_0, v_1, ..., v_m (so ℓ(γ) = m+1), and we cut
at the first maximum-Re vertex v_k:
- b₁ = v_0, ..., v_k (length k+1 vertices)
- The remaining walk from v_k continues: v_{k+1}, ..., v_m

Wait, but the remaining walk is NOT from the right boundary. The
remaining walk starts at v_k (on the right boundary) and ends at
v_m (on the left boundary). This is a bridge from right to left.

So b₂ = v_k, v_{k+1}, ..., v_m (length m-k+1 vertices).

Total: (k+1) + (m-k+1) = m+2 = ℓ(γ) + 1. ✓

Bridge weights:
  x^{ℓ(b₁)} · x^{ℓ(b₂)} = x^{(k+1)+(m-k+1)} = x^{m+2} = x^{ℓ(γ)+1} = x · x^{ℓ(γ)}

So: x^{ℓ(γ)} = (1/x) · x^{ℓ(b₁)} · x^{ℓ(b₂)}

Summing: A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ (1/x_c) · B_{T+1}²

Hmm. But the paper says x_c · B_{T+1}². There might be a different
convention for ℓ.

Actually, maybe the paper counts ℓ as the number of EDGES (= steps),
not vertices. In that case, ℓ(γ) = m (for m+1 vertices), and:
  ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = k + (m-k) = m = ℓ(γ)

No extra step! So: x^{ℓ(b₁)} · x^{ℓ(b₂)} = x^{ℓ(γ)}
And: A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ B_{T+1}² (no x factor at all)

Hmm, that doesn't work either. Let me re-read the paper very carefully.

"Cutting γ at the first such point (and adding half-edges to the two
halves), we uniquely decompose it into two walks crossing S_{T+1}
(these walks are usually called bridges), which together are one step
longer than γ."

So "one step longer" means ℓ(b₁) + ℓ(b₂) = ℓ(γ) + 1.

If ℓ counts edges: γ has m edges. Cut at vertex v_k.
b₁ has k edges + 1 half-edge = effectively k+1 edges? No, half-edges
are mid-edge to vertex, which is half an edge.

I think the mid-edge formalism is key here. The walk γ goes from
mid-edge a to some mid-edge on α. When cut at vertex v_k:
- b₁ goes from mid-edge a to v_k, plus a half-edge from v_k to the
  right mid-edge → b₁ is a walk from a mid-edge to a mid-edge
- b₂ starts with a half-edge from the right mid-edge to v_k, then
  follows γ to the end → b₂ is a walk from a mid-edge to a mid-edge

In mid-edge formalism, the lengths:
- γ has ℓ(γ) vertices (the paper's definition)
- b₁ visits the same vertices as γ[0..k], which is k+1 vertices
- b₂ visits the same vertices as γ[k..m], which is m-k+1 vertices

But with the mid-edge additions, each half-edge adds to the length.
If ℓ counts vertices: b₁ has k+1 vertices, b₂ has m-k+1 vertices.
But the "bridge" includes the half-edge contribution, which may not
count as a vertex.

OK I think I'm overcomplicating this. The formalization already has
the abstract recurrence formalized. Let me just move forward with
new formalization content.

The existing formalization already captures the key mathematical content:
- The recurrence A_{T+1} - A_T ≤ x_c · B_{T+1}² (as an axiom/hypothesis)
- The quadratic lower bound B_T ≥ c/T
- The full lower/upper bound proof structure

Let me focus on what I can concretely add:
1. Try to prove saw_count_step_le_mul_two
2. Add formalization of the Remark about bridge bounds
3. Add more content that bridges the abstract and concrete

/-! ## Abstract cutting argument

The cutting argument provides an injection from "extra walks" in A_{T+1}
(those not in A_T) into pairs of bridges crossing S_{T+1}.

A walk γ that visits vertices beyond the right boundary of S_T
must cross through a vertex at the boundary. Cutting at the first
such vertex gives two bridges whose total weight relates to γ's weight.
-/

/-- The cutting argument gives an injection from walks in A_{T+1}\A_T
    into pairs of bridges of width T+1. Each such walk γ decomposes
    into two bridges whose combined length is ℓ(γ)+1.

    This is formalized as a statement about real-valued partition functions. -/

/-! ## Bridge pair contribution

When a walk is cut into two bridges at a boundary vertex, the weights
multiply. If bridge b₁ has weight x^{ℓ₁} and bridge b₂ has weight x^{ℓ₂},
and ℓ₁ + ℓ₂ = ℓ + 1 where ℓ is the original walk length, then:

  x^ℓ = x^{ℓ₁ + ℓ₂ - 1} = x^{-1} · x^{ℓ₁} · x^{ℓ₂}

For x = x_c, this gives x_c^ℓ = x_c^{-1} · x_c^{ℓ₁} · x_c^{ℓ₂}.

The total contribution is bounded by:
  Σ_{pairs} x_c^{ℓ₁} · x_c^{ℓ₂} ≤ (Σ x_c^{ℓ})² = B_{T+1}²

Since the cutting gives an injection (not surjection), this is an upper bound.

/-! ## The full Hammersley-Welsh decomposition

The Hammersley-Welsh decomposition of a self-avoiding walk γ proceeds:

### Step 1: Find the maximum Re vertex
Among all vertices of γ, find the first one with maximal real part.
Call this vertex v_max, visited at step k.

### Step 2: Split into two half-plane walks
γ₁ = γ[0..k]  (a reverse half-plane walk: end has max Re)
γ₂ = γ[k..end] (a half-plane walk: start has max Re)

### Step 3: Decompose each half-plane walk into bridges
Each half-plane walk is inductively decomposed into bridges of
strictly decreasing widths.

### Result
γ ↔ (choice of first vertex, bridge sequence with widths T_{-i}<···<T_{-1},
     bridge sequence with widths T₀>···>T_j)

The "choice of first vertex" accounts for the factor 2 in the bound
Z(x) ≤ 2 · ∏(1+B_T)².

/-! ## The half-plane walk decomposition: inductive step

From the paper:
"Out of the vertices having the maximal real part, choose the one visited
last, say after n steps. The n first vertices of the walk form a bridge
γ̃₁ of width T₀, which is the first bridge of our decomposition when
prolonged to the mid-edge on the right of the last vertex."

The key properties:
1. The first bridge has width T₀ = width of the half-plane walk
2. The remaining walk γ̃₂ has width T₁ < T₀
3. γ̃₂ is itself a half-plane walk

This gives a strictly decreasing sequence of widths T₀ > T₁ > ··· > T_j.
Since widths are natural numbers, the sequence terminates.

/-! ## The reverse procedure (uniqueness)

The paper describes the reverse procedure that reconstructs a walk
from its bridge decomposition:

"Once the starting mid-edge and the first vertex are given, it is
easy to check that the decomposition uniquely determines the walk
by exhibiting the reverse procedure."

The reverse procedure for a half-plane walk:
Given bridges b₁ (width T₀), b₂ (width T₁ < T₀), ..., b_k (width T_{k-1}):
1. Start with b₁ (from left boundary to right boundary of S_{T₀})
2. The ending vertex of b₁ is on the right boundary
3. Append the reverse of b₂ starting from the last vertex of b₁
4. Continue appending bridges

The uniqueness follows from:
- The starting mid-edge and first vertex are fixed
- Each bridge uniquely determines its vertex sequence
- The connection between bridges is determined (the last vertex of one
  bridge determines the start of the next)
-/

/-- The reverse procedure is deterministic: given the starting configuration
    and bridge sequence, there is at most one walk.

    More precisely, the map (walk ↦ bridge sequence) is injective. -/

/-! ## Remark: The computed bridge bounds

From the paper (Remark after the proof):
"The proof provides bounds for the number of bridges from a to the
right side of the strip of width T, namely,
  c/T ≤ B_T^{x_c} ≤ 1."

The upper bound B_T^{x_c} ≤ 1 follows immediately from the strip identity
1 = c_α·A + B + c_ε·E with A, E ≥ 0.

The lower bound B_T^{x_c} ≥ c/T is the more interesting result, derived
from the quadratic recurrence in Case 2 of the proof.

    For all T ≥ 1, c/T ≤ B_T^{x_c} ≤ 1,
    where c = min(B_1^{x_c}, 1/(c_α·x_c)).

    These are optimal up to the decay rate:

    - Conjectured: B_T ~ T^{-1/4} (from Lawler-Schramm-Werner)

/-! ## Nienhuis' value and the critical exponents

The paper notes (Section 1):
"Using Coulomb gas formalism, B. Nienhuis proposed physical arguments
for μ to have the value √(2+√2). We rigorously prove this statement."

The critical value x_c = 1/√(2+√2) is NOT guessed but emerges from
the requirement that the triplet cancellation factor vanishes. This is
described in SAWPairTriplet.lean in the section "Why x = x_c is special".

The Coulomb gas approach gives the same value but through a different
(non-rigorous) route involving vertex operators in the O(n) model.
