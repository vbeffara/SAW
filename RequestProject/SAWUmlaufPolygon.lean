# The planar-polygon Umlaufsatz (general statement) and its bridge to hex trails

This file develops the **general planar-polygon form** of the discrete Hopf
Umlaufsatz and connects it to the honeycomb-specific core
`hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace` (in
`RequestProject.SAWUmlaufSignedArea`).

The point of this file is to *factor* the remaining topological content of the
discrete Umlaufsatz into two clean, reusable pieces:

1. `polygon_umlaufsatz` — the genuine plane-topology statement: for a
   **non-self-intersecting** closed polygon in `ℂ` (a "simple polygon"), the
   total exterior-angle turning equals `2π · sign(signed area)`.  This is the
   classical Umlaufsatz / turning-tangent theorem for polygons (equivalently
   the Jordan curve theorem for polygons), absent from Mathlib.  It is the
   single irreducible analytic/topological gap.

2. `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polygonSimple` — the honeycomb-specific *planarity*
   fact: the planar polygon obtained by embedding a simple closed hex trail is
   non-self-intersecting (its edges, being honeycomb lattice edges, meet only
   at shared vertices).  This is a finite geometric fact about unit honeycomb
   edges, also absent from Mathlib.

Everything else — the bridge `hexWalkWinding_eq_polyWind` turning the
honeycomb winding into the general polygon exterior-angle sum, the
`polyWind`-append glue identifying the cyclic total turning with
`hexWalkWinding L + closure`, and the reduction of the integer signed-turn core
to the real turning via the already proved `hexWalkWinding_eq_signedTurnCount` /
`hex_closure_arg_eq_sign` — is proved here sorry-free, so that the hex core
`hex_signed_turn_eq_six_sign_shoelace` is genuinely *derived* (in
`RequestProject.SAWUmlaufSignedArea`) from the two clean ingredients above.

This file is imported from `RequestProject.SAWUmlaufSignedArea` (hence
transitively from `RequestProject.SAWFinal`); it is **preparation** for the
Umlaufsatz core.

/-! ## The exterior-angle turning of a polygon in `ℂ`

`polyWind` is the analogue of `hexWalkWinding` for an arbitrary list of points
in `ℂ`: the sum, over consecutive triples, of the exterior turning angle
`arg ((p₂ - p₁) / (p₁ - p₀))`.  It lets us state the Umlaufsatz for genuine
planar polygons, decoupled from the hex lattice. -/

/-- The exterior-angle turning of a polygonal chain `P : List ℂ`: the sum over
    consecutive triples `p₀, p₁, p₂` of the turning angle `arg ((p₂-p₁)/(p₁-p₀))`.
    This is the planar-polygon analogue of `hexWalkWinding`. -/

/-! ## Non-degeneracy of a polygonal chain

`PolygonSimple` (`V.Nodup` plus disjointness of non-adjacent edges) is **not**
by itself enough to make the planar Umlaufsatz true: it does not exclude three
*consecutive* collinear vertices.  For instance the collinear "spike"
`a = 0, b = 2, c = 1` has all three edges pairwise sharing an endpoint (so the
disjointness clause is vacuous) and `V.Nodup`, yet
`polyWind [a,b,c,a,b] = arg(-1/2) + arg(1) + arg(-2) = 2π` while its signed area
`HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c] = 0`, so `2π · sign(area)` would be `-2π ≠ 2π`.

The missing hypothesis is that no three consecutive vertices are collinear,
i.e. every turn has a nonzero cross product.  This is genuinely satisfied by the
honeycomb embedding (every hex turn cross is `±√3/2`, see `hex_turn_cross`), and
it also forces consecutive edges to meet only at their shared vertex, so
together with `PolygonSimple` it gives a genuine simple polygon. -/

/-- A polygonal chain is *non-degenerate* when every consecutive triple
    `p₀, p₁, p₂` has nonzero cross product `cross (p₁ - p₀) (p₂ - p₁)` — i.e. no
    three consecutive vertices are collinear.  Applied to the closed form
    `V ++ [V[0], V[1]]` this asserts that *every* cyclic turn of the polygon is a
    genuine (non-flat, non-spike) corner. -/

**Bridge lemma.**  The honeycomb winding `hexWalkWinding` of a vertex list
    equals the general polygon exterior-angle turning `polyWind` of its planar
    embedding.  This is the link that lets the hex Umlaufsatz core be derived
    from the general planar-polygon Umlaufsatz.

Appending a single point `b` to a chain `W` of length `≥ 2` adds exactly the

/-! ## Non-self-intersection of a closed polygon

A closed polygon is given by its *vertex cycle* `V : List ℂ` (no repeated
closing vertex).  Its closed edges are the consecutive pairs together with the
wrap-around pair, packaged by `closedEdges`. -/

/-- The closed edges of the vertex cycle `V` as ordered pairs:
    `(V₀,V₁), (V₁,V₂), …, (V_{n-1}, V₀)`.  Built as `V.zip (V.rotate 1)`. -/
def closedEdges (V : List ℂ) : List (ℂ × ℂ) := V.zip (V.rotate 1)

/-- Predicate: the closed polygon with vertex cycle `V` (no repeated closing
    vertex) is *non-self-intersecting* — distinct edges that share no endpoint
    are disjoint segments.  Together with `V.Nodup`, edges that share exactly
    one endpoint are adjacent and meet only at that vertex, so this is the
    genuine "simple polygon in the plane" condition. -/
def PolygonSimple (V : List ℂ) : Prop :=
  V.Nodup ∧
  ∀ e₁ ∈ closedEdges V, ∀ e₂ ∈ closedEdges V,
    e₁.1 ≠ e₂.1 → e₁.1 ≠ e₂.2 → e₁.2 ≠ e₂.1 → e₁.2 ≠ e₂.2 →
    Disjoint (segment ℝ e₁.1 e₁.2) (segment ℝ e₂.1 e₂.2)

/-- **The planar-polygon Umlaufsatz (remaining topological core).**  For a
    non-self-intersecting closed polygon with vertex cycle `V` (`3 ≤ V.length`,
    `PolygonSimple V`), the total exterior-angle turning around the cycle equals
    `2π · sign (signed area)`, where the signed area is `HexArea.shoelace2 V`.

    The total turning is expressed as `polyWind (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])`: appending
    the first two vertices closes the cycle so that every one of the `V.length`
    cyclic turns is counted exactly once.

    This is the classical Hopf Umlaufsatz / turning-tangent theorem for
    polygons (equivalently the Jordan curve theorem for polygons).  It is the
    single irreducible plane-topology gap, absent from Mathlib.  Proof route:
    ear-clipping induction on `V.length` (a simple polygon with `≥ 4` vertices
    has an ear; ear removal preserves `PolygonSimple`; the signed area changes
    by the ear triangle term `HexArea.shoelace2_ear` and the turning by the
    matching ear angle), with the triangle base case.

    **Non-degeneracy hypothesis `hnd`.**  `PolygonSimple` alone does *not* make
    this statement true: it allows three consecutive collinear vertices (a flat
    vertex or a "spike"), for which the disjointness clause is vacuous but the
    turning over/undercounts relative to `2π·sign(area)` (e.g. the spike
    `0, 2, 1`).  The extra hypothesis `polyNondeg (V ++ [V[0], V[1]])` rules
    these out (every cyclic turn is a genuine corner), restoring truth.  It is
    satisfied by the honeycomb embedding via `hexEmbeddedPolygon_polyNondeg`. -/

/-
**Triangle base case of the planar Umlaufsatz.**  For a non-degenerate
    triangle (`HexArea.cross (b-a) (c-b) ≠ 0`, i.e. `a, b, c` not collinear), the
    total cyclic exterior-angle turning `polyWind [a,b,c,a,b]` equals
    `2π · sign (signed area)`.

    Proof: the three turn ratios `r₁=(c-b)/(b-a)`, `r₂=(a-c)/(c-b)`,
    `r₃=(b-a)/(a-c)` have product `1`, so by `Complex.arg_mul_coe_angle` the sum
    of their args is `0` in `Real.Angle`, i.e. a multiple of `2π`.  The three
    triangle cross products `cross (b-a)(c-b) = cross (c-b)(a-c) = cross (a-c)(b-a)`
    are all equal to the signed area `HexArea.shoelace2 [a,b,c]` (via
    `HexArea.shoelace2_triple` and `cross_triangle_eq_cross_edges`), so the three
    `Im rᵢ` share the sign of the area, forcing each `arg rᵢ` strictly into
    `(0,π)` (area > 0) or `(-π,0)` (area < 0).  The sum then lies in `(0,3π)` resp.
    `(-3π,0)` and is a multiple of `2π`, hence `±2π`.  This is the base case of the
    ear-clipping induction for `polygon_umlaufsatz`.

/-- For any honeycomb trail `M` (a `HexTrailList`), the embedded chain

    genuine hex turn, whose cross product is `±√3/2 ≠ 0`
    (`hex_turn_cross_ne_zero`).  Clean structural induction matching the

The closed honeycomb vertex cycle `L.dropLast ++ [L[0], L[1]]` (the interior
    vertices followed by the first two vertices, closing the loop and exposing
    the two closing turns) is itself a `HexTrailList`.  The interior adjacencies
    / no-backtracks come from `HexTrailList L`; the two closing turns come from
    `hex_closure_adj` and `hex_closure_nobacktrack`; the remaining junction
    no-backtrack `s(L[m-3],L[m-2]) ≠ s(L[m-2],L[0])` follows from
    `hex_closed_trail_start_not_interior` (`L[0] ≠ L[m-3]`).
