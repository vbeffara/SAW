# Diagonal-split combinatorial infrastructure for the Meisters ear search

This file collects the **purely combinatorial list-surgery** facts needed by the
diagonal-split recursion at the heart of the discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz
(`exists_empty_corner_avoiding` in `RequestProject.SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

The Meisters "two-ears" proof proceeds by strong induction on the number of
vertices: a simple polygon with `≥ 4` vertices has an interior diagonal joining
two non-adjacent vertices; rotating so the diagonal joins `V[0]` and `V[k]`
(`2 ≤ k ≤ V.length - 2`), the diagonal cuts the cycle into two strictly shorter
sub-polygons that share exactly the diagonal:

* `chordLeft  V k = V₀, V₁, …, V_k`              (`= V.take (k+1)`)
* `chordRight V k = V_k, V_{k+1}, …, V_{n-1}, V₀` (`= V.drop k ++ V.take 1`)

The genuinely *topological* facts (that such a diagonal exists, and that each
sub-polygon is again `PolygonSimple`) are the Jordan-curve-theorem-level content
and live with the open core.  Everything in **this** file is the elementary
bookkeeping that surrounds them: the lengths of the two pieces, that they are
both strictly shorter than `V` yet still have `≥ 3` vertices, that together they
cover every vertex of `V`, and that they meet the shared diagonal correctly at
their endpoints (`head?`/`getLast?`).

This file is **preparation**: it is imported by `RequestProject.SAWUmlaufPolygon`
(hence transitively from `RequestProject.SAWFinal`), so it is part of the build
chain.  Its lemmas are designed to be consumed by the eventual proof of
`exists_empty_corner_avoiding`; they are not yet referenced by another
declaration only because the core they feed is still open.  This is intentional,
recorded partial progress, not a dead branch.
