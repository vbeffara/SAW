# Diagonal-split combinatorial infrastructure for the Meisters ear search

This file collects the **purely combinatorial list-surgery** facts needed by the
diagonal-split recursion at the heart of the discrete Hopf Umlaufsatz
(`exists_empty_corner_avoiding` in `RequestProject.SAWUmlaufPolygon`).

The Meisters "two-ears" proof proceeds by strong induction on the number of
vertices: a simple polygon with `≥ 4` vertices has an interior diagonal joining
two non-adjacent vertices; rotating so the diagonal joins `V[0]` and `V[k]`
(`2 ≤ k ≤ V.length - 2`), the diagonal cuts the cycle into two strictly shorter
sub-polygons that share exactly the diagonal:

* `chordLeft  V k = V₀, V₁, …, V_k`              (`= V.take (k+1)`)
* `chordRight V k = V_k, V_{k+1}, …, V_{n-1}, V₀` (`= V.drop k ++ V.take 1`)

The genuinely *topological* facts (that such a diagonal exists, and that each
sub-polygon is again `PolygonSimple`) are the Jordan-curve-theorem-level content
and live with the open core.  Everything in **this** file is the elementary
bookkeeping that surrounds them: the lengths of the two pieces, that they are
both strictly shorter than `V` yet still have `≥ 3` vertices, that together they
cover every vertex of `V`, and that they meet the shared diagonal correctly at
their endpoints (`head?`/`getLast?`).

This file is **preparation**: it is imported by `RequestProject.SAWUmlaufPolygon`
(hence transitively from `RequestProject.SAWFinal`), so it is part of the build
chain.  Its lemmas are designed to be consumed by the eventual proof of
`exists_empty_corner_avoiding`; they are not yet referenced by another
declaration only because the core they feed is still open.  This is intentional,
recorded partial progress, not a dead branch.

**Signed-area additivity across the chord cut (sorry-free, reusable).**
    Cutting the closed polygon `V` along the diagonal `V[0]–V[k]`
    (`1 ≤ k < V.length`) into the two pieces `chordLeft V k` and
    `chordRight V k` is *area-preserving*: the (twice-)signed areas of the two
    pieces add up to that of `V`.  The shared diagonal contributes
    `cross V[k] V[0]` to the left piece and `cross V[0] V[k]` to the right
    piece, and these cancel (`cross_antisymm`); the remaining open chains
    reassemble the closed shoelace of `V`.

    This is the pure-algebra ingredient of the orientation transfer in the
    interior-branch ear lift (`meisters_reduction_interior2`): a chord piece
    has the *same* orientation sign as `V` exactly when the OTHER piece's area
    has the same sign, which the Jordan-interior diagonal guarantees.  Recorded
    preparation; not a dead branch.

**The two chord pieces share only the two cut vertices.**  For a `Nodup`
    cycle `V` cut at `1 ≤ k < V.length`, a vertex lying in BOTH `chordLeft V k`
    and `chordRight V k` must be one of the two diagonal endpoints `V[0]` or
    `V[k]`.  This is the vertex-disjointness needed for *piece selection* in the
    split branches (`meisters_reduction_interior2`, `empty_branch_bad_lift`): a
    forbidden cyclic edge `{z1,z2}` that lands in one piece cannot have an
    interior vertex of the other piece equal to `z1` or `z2`, so the ear tip
    returned by recursion on the other piece avoids the forbidden pair.

/-- **Split-recursion tip avoids the forbidden pair (pure combinatorics).**  For
    a `Nodup` cycle `W` cut at `1 ≤ k < W.length`, suppose the ear tip `b'`
    returned by recursion on one chord piece is an *interior* vertex of that
    piece (`b' ≠ W[0]`, `b' ≠ W[k]`), while the target vertex `z` lies in the
    OTHER piece.  Then `b' ≠ z`.  Reason: if `b' = z` then `z` lies in BOTH
    pieces, so by `chord_pieces_inter` `z` is one of the two cut endpoints
    `W[0]!`/`W[k]!`, contradicting that `b'` is an interior vertex.  This is
    exactly the `b' ≠ z1, z2` bookkeeping the diagonal-split branches
    (`meisters_reduction_interior2`, `empty_branch_bad_lift`) need: recursing on
    the piece NOT containing the forbidden edge yields a tip avoiding both
